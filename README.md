Decision-making in large-scale games is an essential research area in artificial intelligence (AI) with significant real-world impact. **AuctionNet** is a benchmark for bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions derived from a real-world online advertising platform. AuctionNet is composed of three parts: 

- 🌏️ **Ad Auction Environment**: The environment effectively replicates the integrity and complexity of real-world ad auctions with the interaction of several modules: the ad opportunity generation module, the bidding module, and the auction module. 

- 🔢 **Pre-Generated Dataset**: We pre-generated a substantial dataset based on the auction environment. The dataset contains trajectories with 48 diverse agents competing with each other, totaling over 500 million records and 80GB in size.

- ✴️ **Several Baseline Bid Decision-Making Algorithms**: We implemented a variety of baseline algorithms such as linear programming, reinforcement learning, and generative models.

We note that AuctionNet is applicable not only to research on bid decision-making algorithms in ad auctions but also to the general area of **decision-making** in large-scale games. It can also benefit researchers in a broader range of areas such as reinforcement learning, generative models, operational research, and mechanism design.

Bid decision-making in large-scale ad auctions is a concrete example of decision-making in large-scale games.  
Numbers 1 through 5 illustrate how an auto-bidding agent helps advertisers optimize performance.  
For each advertiser's unique objective (I), the auto-bidding agent makes bid decision-making (II) for continuously arriving ad opportunities and competes against each other in the ad auction (III).  
Then, each agent may win some impressions (IV), which may be exposed to users and potentially result in conversions. Finally, the agents' performance (V) will be reported to advertisers.

## 🧑‍💻 Quickstart

---

### Create and activate conda environment
```bash
$ conda create -n AuctionNet python=3.9.12 pip=23.0.1
$ conda activate AuctionNet
```
### Install requirements
```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Train Strategy & Offline Evaluation
*For detailed usage, please refer to `strategy_train_env/README_strategy_train.md`.*

```
cd strategy_train_env  # Enter the strategy_train directory
```
#### Data Processing
Run this script to convert the raw data on ad opportunities granularity into trajectory data required for model training.
```
python  bidding_train_env/train_data_generator/train_data_generator.py
```

#### Strategy Training
Load the training data and train the xxx (for example, IQL) bidding strategy.
```
python main/main_iql.py 
```

Use the xxxBiddingStrategy as the PlayerBiddingStrategy for evaluation.
```
bidding_train_env/strategy/__init__.py
from .iql_bidding_strategy import IqlBiddingStrategy as PlayerBiddingStrategy
```

#### Offline Evaluation
Load the raw data on ad opportunities granularity to construct an offline evaluation environment for assessing the bidding strategy offline.
```
python main/main_test.py
```

### Online Evaluation
Set up the hyperparameters for the online evaluation process.
```
config/test.gin
